# Uses

This is an occasionally updated list of the tech I use.

## Furniture
- I sit on a [YouToo Ergonomic Chair](https://ergonofis.com/en-us/products/youtoo-ergonomic-chair?variant=42615992484089)
- My desk is the [Fully Jarvis Bamboo Desk](https://store.hermanmiller.com/standing-desks/jarvis-bamboo-standing-desk/2542428.html?lang=en_US)

## Computers
- My personal laptop is a 14inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro processor
- My work laptop is a 16inch Intel MacBook Pro
- I have a custom built gaming PC

## Peripherals
- I use a custom mechanical keyboard made with the Tofu75 Kit(discontinued) and [ZealPC Zilents 67g switches](https://zealpc.net/products/zilent?variant=5894832324646)
- I click things with the Logitech MX Master 2S(discontinued)
- My monitor is the [LG 38WP85C-W Curved Ultrawide Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BP1P4BG)
- I use an LG webcam
- [AudioTechnica AT2040 Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BFPNW2J)
- [Elgato Microphone Arm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09737ZXMK)
- [Focusrite Scarlet Solo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E6T56CM)

> All my computers use the same set of hardware. I plug everything into a USB switch that then has two outputs. One goes the monitor and one goes to the gaming PC. Then the monitor connects to the Gaming PC via DisplayPort and to either laptop via USB-C.
> 
> This is a bit quirky because I have to change the output on the USB switch, the input on the monitor, and which laptop the USB-C is plugged into depending on what computer I want to use. But it's been the only real solution since I couldn't find a KVM that let me use VSync for games.
