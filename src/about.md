title: About
---

I'm Elise Shaffer. I grew up in western Pennsylvia and attended the University
of Pittsburgh, where I got a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 

Since then, I've working in the tech industry. I have twelve years of experience
in various fields, including web development, DevOps, and robotics. In September
of 2019, I came out and began living as a transgender woman. I use she/her
pronouns. My transition journey has been a long one, but it's the been the most
impactful and positive change I've made in for myself in recent years. Being
trans has really informed how I look at tech. I used to believe that tech would
be a power force for progress in the world. However, I now realize that it's
about us choosing to be a force for good. And far too often, we don't. 

I love Ruby. It's my favorite language. It was the first language I learned that
seemed custom made for my brain. When I first learned Ruby, I could guess the
method names and signatures I needed for a particular task and usually, I'd be
right or slightly off. It was a welcome breath of fresh air. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy rock climbing, board games, and cooking. Some of
my favorite things are fantasy books, productivity, quiet time to myself. I'm a
whole person, looking to live my best life as my authentic self.
