👋🏻 Hey! I'm Elise and I use she/her pronouns. I'm a Rubyist, an engineering manager, and a trans
woman living in Longmont, CO.

I've worked in the Security, Payments, and consumer electronics
industries. I also give talks, develop courses, and blog about various
topics.

In my spare time, I enjoy cycling, climbing, cooking, and reading.
