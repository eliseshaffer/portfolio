Hello, there! I'm Elise. I'm a trans woman, ruby developer, and reader.
My pronouns are she/her.

I live in Longmont, CO. 

I recently moved into an Engineering Manager roll at Red Canary. I'm a member of
WNB.rb and I organized the trans issues panel at Ruby Conf Mini 2022.

I've also been taking a more activist roll in working for diversity in tech,
specifically around trans people in tech.  Tech is not neutral. It's a
statement of our values. II am focused on being a good mentor to the community
and building content to help grow engineers in the ruby space.

I have a computer science degree from the University of Pittsburgh. Most of my
career has been focused on Ruby and Rails, but I've also worked in embedded
programming, DevOps, and recently management.
