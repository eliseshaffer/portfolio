👋🏻 Hey! I'm Elise and I use she/her pronouns. I'm a Rubyist, an engineering manager, and a trans
woman living in Longmont, CO.

I work at [Red Canary](https://redcanary.com), where I lead the team
building our integrations for Network, Endpoint, and SIEM products. I also
give talks, develop courses, and build Rails apps on the side. 

Previously, I've worked in a variety of industries including juvenile
products, consumer electronics, and fintech using Ruby, Rails, and
Embedded C.

In my spare time, I enjoy cycling, climbing, cooking, and reading.
