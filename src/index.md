👋🏻 Hey! I'm Elise and I use she/her pronouns. I'm a Rubyist, cyclist, and 
trans woman living in Denver, CO. 

I'm the host of [The Ruby On Rails Podcast](https://www.therubyonrailspodcast.com/).

I've worked in the security, payments, and consumer electronics
industries. View my full [resume here](/resume).

In my spare time, I enjoy cycling, cooking, and reading.

I keep a list of the tech I use [here](/uses).
