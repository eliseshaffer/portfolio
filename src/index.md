# Elise Shaffer

I use she/her pronouns. I'm a programmer, podcaster, and trans woman living in 
Denver, CO. 

I've worked in web development for 14 years and I have extensive experience 
with Ruby on Rails. I host 
[The Ruby on Rails Podcast](https://www.therubyonrailspodcast.com/), a weekly 
conversation about topics relevant to the Rails community. 

I love working on products that make people's lives better. I've worked in the 
computer security, subscriptions billing, and consumer electronics industries.
